# FullscreenLock

Original Code/Upstream Repository: https://github.com/torradmin/fullscreenlock

Provide fullscreen mouse boundaries for games that don't.

Improved version by me. Pressing shift allows to temporarily get away from apps. alt+tab also works.

Also added configurable application specific settings that save for where the mouse should be locked within the screen when it detects a fullscreen application.

This is a program that locks the cursor to the primary monitor for games where the devs were too incompetent to do so themselves.

In certain games, for example CS:GO, GTA V in windowed fullscreen and Skyrim, the mouse will not be locked to the primary monitor.
This can cause a user to drag the cursor out of the program, click, suddenly minimize the game and have to switch back in.

## Why make this program?

The original(?) PrimaryLock by AKADEVIL does the job well, but it is a little rudimentary, in that it just locks the cursor as long as PrimaryLock is open. 

My improved version doesn't lock the cursor if you alt-tab out manually or if no fullscreen application is open, allowing much more seamless switching to music players etc.
This also lets you keep the application open while no game is running, so that you don't have to keep in mind to open the application every time you start the game.

All this is made possible by watching what window is focused. Any window both fullscreen and in focus will trigger the primary monitor lock.

# Demo

Here's a demonstration of mouse movement when:
- A focused window becomes fullscreen
- A fullscreen window loses focus
- A fullscreen window regains focus
- A focused, fullscreen window regains window decorations.
